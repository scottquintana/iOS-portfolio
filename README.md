# Active Dispatch
While looking for a free API to build an app around, I discoved one that was based right here in Nashville. Active Dispatch connects you to the Metro Nashville Police Department and shows all of thier active calls. You can see where there are on a list, or by seeing a map overview of the city. You can also click on each individual incident to get a closer view of the location. This app uses UIKit, however, it was inspired by things I've been doing in SwiftUI recently (gradients, reactive color changes, and the MVVM architecture).
